We are using week 17 data as a showcase since the schedule had games in 5 out of 6 straight days. Unfortunately there are no bye teams, however, it is just a matter of cutting and pasting teams around just like you would while making the schedule. 

I think the simple fix for this for next season is to input the entire schedule when it is released and just create a slider widget to select the week for the website.
